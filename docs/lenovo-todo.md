Set the timeout to a longer duration or select Never (if available).

Install an app like "Stay Awake" or "Caffeine" from the Google Play Store.
Configure the app to keep the screen on while the Home Assistant app is active.

Enable Developer Options:
Go to Settings > About Tablet > Build Number.
Tap the Build Number 7 times to unlock Developer Options.

2. Removing the Sidebar in Home Assistant
You can remove or hide the sidebar for a cleaner interface using the Kiosk Mode integration.

Install Kiosk Mode:

Go to HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) > Frontend > Search for Kiosk Mode.
Install the Kiosk Mode integration.
Restart Home Assistant.
Configure Kiosk Mode:

  hide_sidebar: true
  hide_header: true
  exceptions:
    - user: AdminUser
      config:
        hide_sidebar: false
        hide_header: false

If you're using a browser (e.g., Chrome or Fully Kiosk Browser), you can enable full-screen mode to remove the sidebar:

In Chrome, tap the three dots menu > Select Add to Home Screen to create a full-screen web app.
For Fully Kiosk Browser, go to its settings and enable Fullscreen Mode.
3. Accessing Cameras in Home Assistant
You can easily view your cameras in Home Assistant on the tablet.
